## Main Purpose
Earthquakes data analyzation through the years, deductive reasoning and parameters prediction using ML


## Acquisition
* Data from kaggele

Concat all information to one database

## Data Cleaning
Exploring & improving the data
* Format normalization
* Duplicates & nulls handling


## Visualisation
* Explaining the data through graphs
* Buiild interactive maps according to locationes, times & volumes

## Machine Learning
* Predict the volume of the next earthquake by location
* Predict the probability to low, medium & high earthquakes by location

## Interpretion

* what we found
- You will find addition information in the project presentation
